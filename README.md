# RU-PRISMM
The codebase for Northeastern's Mars Ice Team

## TODO

- Firmware
  - Create Classes to represent different sub-systems
  - Incorperate thermistors
- RPi Software
  - Create basic MSGs and SRVs
  - Decide on the number of Pis needed
- UI:
  - RQT window for image views
  - RQT window for interaction with prismm
    - Create simple radio button interaction with ROS
    - Decide how to split up window
    - Brainstorm all needed functions
    - Prototype window that interacts with ROS
 - Misc
  - Create datalogger (save to file, csv?)
    - Create (MATLAB) code to view data log
  - Decide what is needed to analyze sensor data to evaluate a digital core

Look into:
- PID on the drill (more magnets for better rpm measurement)
- Creating configs for different components that are loaded at startup (with params)
-
